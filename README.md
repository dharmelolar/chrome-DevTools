As a technical writer, most times you’ll be required to use the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach when working on documentation and Git is one of the important tools used.

**Resources to learn Git**

* [Official Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)
* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials)

### GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket <a href="#f245" id="f245"></a>

GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are popular version control platforms that share many similar features. They all provide a centralized location for storing and managing code repositories, enabling collaborative development.

These platforms offer features like code versioning, branching, merging, issue tracking, and project management. Different organizations use either of these platforms depending on their needs and requirements.

One notable difference among them is that they are owned by different organizations, with GitHub owned by Microsoft, GitLab operated by GitLab Inc., and Bitbucket managed by Atlassian.
